Hello,
I hope you are having a wonderful day.

My name is Toru Murakami. 
I'm a full stack developer, a software engineer, and a designer.

I am a Computer Science Major / Graphic Design Minor student at Morningside University, and I am graduating in May, 2022.

This is my little portfolio website to show what I like, what my skills are.
I absolutely love learning computer science, but I especially like web technology.
If you are looking for a web developer or software engineer, please do not hesitate to contact me.
